Arcade Locker
=============

This project uses a standard school locker with two 8*8 holes grids. 5Â mm LEDs fits beautifully in those holes, small tactile switches too, a LCD display can be added in the name's tag space, thus a boring locker can be easily transformed into a multi-game arcade cabinet. Enjoy! (menus only in French for now)

Requirements
------------

* [Arduino (I use a Nano with an ATmega328)](http://www.banggood.com/ATmega328P-Nano-V3-Controller-Board-Compatible-Arduino-p-940937.html)
* [MAX7219/MAX7221 with 8*8 LED matrix](http://www.banggood.com/MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-MCU-LED-Display-Control-Module-Kit-For-Arduino-p-915478.html)

Please look at [`config.h`](src/config.h) to configure the system and pins


Compilation
-----------

I actually use [Arturo](https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo) to compile the sketck. If you use the Arduino IDE, you must:

* Install the LedControl library (copy [`lib/LedControl`](lib/LedControl) directory in your `libraries` folder or use the Library Manager (Arduino >= 1.6.2))
* Add `#include <LedControl.h>` at the top of [`src/ArcadeLocker.ino`](src/ArcadeLocker.ino)
* Put all files in [`src`](src) in a directory named `ArcadeLocker`
