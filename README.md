IntelliCasier
=============

This project uses a standard school locker with two 8*8 holes grids. 5Â mm LEDs fits beautifully in those holes, small tactile switches too, a LCD display can be added in the name's tag space, thus a boring locker can be easily transformed into a multi-game arcade cabinet. Enjoy!

* [MAX7219/MAX7221 with 8*8 LED matrix](http://www.banggood.com/MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-MCU-LED-Display-Control-Module-Kit-For-Arduino-p-915478.html)

Please look at [`config.h`](src/config.h) to configure the system and pins.


Compilation
-----------

I currently use [Arturo](https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo) to compile the sketch. If you want to use the Arduino IDE, you must:

* Copy all libraries in [`lib`](lib) in Arduino's `libraries` folder or use the Library Manager to install them (Arduino IDE >= 1.6.2))
* Add `#include <LedControl.h>`, `#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>` and `#include <Sodaq_3231>` at the top of [`src/ArcadeLocker.ino`](src/ArcadeLocker.ino)
* Rename the [`src`](src) directory to `ArcadeLocker`


Todo
----

* Better localization system (kind of ugly right now, I guess?)
* Events handling optimization (loops)
* Enhance `newLcdScroll()` (start position, spaces before looping)
* Settings storage in EEPROM
* High scores with the ability to enter a name or initials
* **Maybe add a custom `malloc()` to dynamically allocate app's variable memory and not having all those global variables taking place in memory (or just use `malloc()`?)**
* **Put animations instead of scrolling text on matrix and maybe remove all that code to scroll text on the matrix now that there is an LCD display**
* Remove unnecessary timer events when first launching them in games (just call the callback function, no need to wait on start)
* Reorganize functions order in apps' code to stay consistent between them
* Enhance `printLcd()` to center text automatically? (would consume cycles using `strlen()`)
* Put strings buffers in an array?
* Add animations to screensaver
